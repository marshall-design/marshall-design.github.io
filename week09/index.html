        <h2 id="quoteOne">"Where a visual space is an organized continuum of a uniformed connected kind, the ear world is a world of simultaneous relationships."</h2>
        <h2 id="quoteTwo">"They suspect the ear; they don't trust it. In general we feel more secure when things are visible, when we can "see for ourselves."</h2>
        <h2 id="quoteThree">"The phonetic alphabet forced the magic world of the ear to yield to the neutral world of the eye."</h2>
        <h2 id="quoteFour">"Until writing was invented, man lived in acoustic space: boundless, directionless, horizonless, in the dark of the mind, in the world of emotion, by primordial intuition, by terror."</h2>
        <h2 id="quoteFive">"The ear favors no particular "point of view.""</h2>
