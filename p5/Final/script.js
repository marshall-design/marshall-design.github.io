let one = ["I had a dream about him last night...",
"At first, he was silent, but after noticing me, he told me that he was still in space...",
"Do you think this means something?",
"What will become of me?"]
let two = ["Me too, I have my own theories...",
"The last time I spoke with him was right before they shipped him off to deliver supplies to the colonies...",
"Do you remember when those colonies were established? Or are you too young?",
"Well it must mean something..."]
let three = ["Of course, of course...",
"It must not even seem strange to you that people live everywhere now...",
"Everywhere, that word seems different too now...",
"Isn't it strange that people live everywhere now?"]
let four = ["He was on one of the first ships to crash...",
"They think it was in the third month of their journey that they crashed. He was asleep, and I am thankful for that...",
"They were all asleep really. That’s all anyone does on those long trips through space..."]
let five = ["That must not even seem strange to you too...",
"No one used to sleep that like...",
"At the most twelve hours...",
"It is amazing...",
"By: Marshall Murphy"]
let six = ["It was unthinkable to sleep for years...",
"We used to call that a coma...",
"But now it’s nothing. People sleep for decades just to go on vacation. Have you ever thought that’s strange?",
"I can't believe that only a century ago, sleeping for years was impossible..."]
let seven = ["No, no, I guess you wouldn’t...",
"No one runs into anyone anymore. I can't remember the last time I saw a friend by chance...",
"They’re all just asleep most of the time. It frightens me really...",
"I find it very strange too..."]
let eight = ["Well, let’s say I’m going on vacation...",
"To one of those planets made up entirely of sunny beaches...",
"I love those places...",]
let nine = ["And they tell me that the journey will take forty years...",
"So they freeze me, and I’m out cold turkey...",
"And in those forty years, I have no control over anything. The ship, my body, society, they all do whatever they please..."]
let ten = ["Nevertheless, let’s say the ship crashes. Then I meet the same fate as him...",
"Wouldn’t be the worst way to go... ",
"However, it wasn’t really on my itinerary for the vacation...",
"Well, let’s say the ship crashes. Then I meet the same fate as him..."]
let eleven = ["Or my body...",
"The chamber malfunctions and freezes me to a point where thawing leaves me as a sac of fluids...",
"You know that’s happened before? Don’t you?"]
let twelve = ["Regardless, these are fine enough because although I would be dead, I would never know...",
"I would never know that the shipped crashed or that the chamber malfunctioned...",
"I would just be the same as I was before..."]
let thirteen = ["Those scenarios don’t bother me too much...",
"It’s society, my loved ones, technology...",
"What happens if they start progressing too quickly while I’m asleep. Have you considered this scenario before?"]
let fourteen = ["Everyone is worried about the physical during these journeys...",
"Is this making sense?",
"Do you understand what I mean?"]
let fifteen = ["Another scenario then...",
"Let’s say in the eighth year of my journey, we figure out how to expedite space travel...",
"They improve the old ships so much that a forty year trip can now be done in days, even hours...",
"Another scenario then to make it clearer..."]
let sixteen = ["However, my ship is still set to arrive at the beachy planet in thirty-eight more years...",
"And during these thirty years, my children grow old and their children do too...",
"And they live most of their lives without me in it..."]
let seventeen = ['"Where has she gone?"',
'"Oh, she\’s still on vacation..."',
'"She’s been on vacation forever..."']
let eighteen = ["I sleep away their whole life...",
"This is what worries me...",
"I guess I will ask again. Have you ever thought that’s strange?"]
let nineteen = ["No, no, I guess you wouldn’t...",
"Sometimes I wonder if his ship ever really did crash...",
"Or if it’s instead off course drifting into deep space like he told me...",
"Well then I guess my point wasn't made..."]
let twenty = ["He would never know, and I guess I wouldn’t either...",
"We actually don't know anything ever...",
"Which is why, everynight as I fall sleep, I ask myself..."]
