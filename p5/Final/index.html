<!-- PLEASE READ this
I have been trying to figure out how to get the canvas
to react to the size of the window, and it cannot be done
without using scale() which ends up messing up where the canvas
reads where the user's mouse is clicking. I know how to do it with
the frame image. That's easy. I just can't figure it out with the
canvas. The only way to do it is if I change my canvas size in p5 go
windowwidth, but this does not work because I coded everything using
actual numbers and did not reference the canvas size for all of my
measurements. There is no way to do it without basically resizing everything
in my whole project which I don't have time to do. I guess lesson learned.
Always reference everything back to the canvas size so it can be reshaped
later. Anyways, thanks for a great semester! -->
