    Vannevar Bush’s “memex” device is a somewhat estranged relative to<br>
    the computer. Although the device was never used, it functions<br>
    similarly to contemporary computers. However, it differs mostly in<br>
    its structure.Bush describes a memex as a desk with protruding<br>
    screens. He notes that it is stationary but can still be used when<br>
    a user is away from it. Subsequently, a memex blends current objects<br>
    into one super machine. It is both a computer and the desk on which<br>
    it sits. It is both a desktop computer and a phone since it is<br>
    operational from a distance. The memex is interesting because it<br>
    feels like Frankenstein’s monster, an amalgamation of disparate<br>
    objects. This peculiar machine never actually existed in our timeline.<br>
    However, one can find many contemporary technologies that exist<br>
    within it, which is why it feels both familiar and alien.<br>

    Tim Berners-Lee’s essay wants to have a completely open web where<br>
    information and data from websites become almost universal. For<br>
    Berners-Lee, companies or groups with closed-sites are slowly<br>
    halting the internets flow through paywalls and isolated<br>
    applications. As users create site-specific accounts and<br>
    subscriptions, they become static internet users. Their ideas and<br>
    inputs, instead of traveling from site to site or friend to friend,<br>
    are suffocated by the walls websites are building around themselves.<br>
    These points are what worry Berners-Lee who believes that as the<br>
    internet divides itself, it becomes more exclusionary and<br>
    subsequently less useful. For him, what made the internet<br>
    magnificent was its openness, which is why as the internet becomes<br>
    more separated, it will lose its usefulness.<br>
